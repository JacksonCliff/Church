        meditation : "God's anger or the difficulties He allows us to go through are temporary and serve a purpose—often to refine, teach, or correct us. However, His favor, love, and grace are lasting and constant.

It acknowledges that there will be times in life where we face real sorrow, and it’s okay to grieve or struggle in those moments. However, the promise is that this weeping is temporary—it lasts for a \"night,\" but joy is coming. The \"morning\" symbolizes a new beginning, hope, and the restoration of joy.hold on through the tough times, knowing that God’s joy and deliverance will come." ,
