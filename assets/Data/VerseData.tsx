        meditation : "God's anger or the difficulties He allows us to go through are temporary and serve a purpose—often to refine, teach, or correct us. However, His favor, love, and grace are lasting and constant.

However, the promise is that this weeping is temporary—it lasts for a \"night,\" but joy is coming. The \"morning\" symbolizes a new beginning, hope, and the restoration of joy.hold on through the tough times, knowing that God’s joy and deliverance will come." ,
